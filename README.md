# Deep-Learning-Project-2023

In this project, we improved the classification performance on EuroSAT-RGB dataset using different strategies.

1. We downloaded and read the [miniImageNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17a09kkqVivZQFggCw9I_YboJ23tcexNM). Here, we focused on the train.tar file and split the data as train, val and test datasets.
2. We pre-trained three models - ResNet18, VGG16 and Vision Transformer (ViT) with the best optimizers on the Training Set of MiniImageNet and then evaluated on the Validation Set and tested on the Testing Set.
3. We then saved the checkpoints for each of the models used to later use them on EuroSAT-RGB dataset.
4. 

The model checkpoints can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rrPXO8zfcdm-FPuZwXu-LAX-ADByVseL?usp=sharing)


We implemented the code on Kaggle.
